## Posts mobile project
This project was developed using SwiftUI with MVVM architecture to separate the bussines logic from the views. 
I used cocoa pods to install swiftlint a library that simplifies http reguests. 
And Swift package manager to add Refresahble a package that add refreshable support to lists on iOS 13 and 14.
To run the project you have to previouslly install cocoa pods, clone this repository and open the iOS-Test.xcworkspace file
and press the button run. 
To refresh the list pull down, use the switch to filter by favorites and touch a post to see it's details and delete it or add it to favorites.
